# Binary Tree

## Max Value

Write a method extending Binary Trees that returns the maximum value in a binary tree.

**int max()**

**Unit Tests**

 1. “Happy Path” The largest number is somewhere in the tree.
 2. The tree is empty.
 3. The tree has a single node.
 4. The highest value is the first value.
 5. The highest value is a leaf.


## Breadth First Traversal

breadthFirstTraverse() is a method in the Binary Tree Class that prints out values of a binary tree. It is implemented using a queue (from this repo's queue class) and a while loop. It takes in a tree, and outputs integers.
