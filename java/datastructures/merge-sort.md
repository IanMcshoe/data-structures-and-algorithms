# Merge sort

The Merge Sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is based on the Divide and Conquer paradigm. Today we will be going over an example. In this algorithm, the array is initially divided into two equal halves and then they are combined in a sorted manner.

**Trace**

This is our sample array. At each point in our iterations we will demonstrate whats happening within our code.

Sample Array: [8,4,23,42,16,15]

**Pass 1**

Check if the left half of the array is less than the right half, if yes then calculate its mid point.


**Pass 2**


**Pass 3**


**Pass 4**


**Pass 5**


**Pass 6**
